# list-of-list-TUI
A project to study OOP make a class of object called Sprit that can make instances of that object with x and y coordiates that refer to a nected list I contunally update prrint and clear. That make a sort of old graphics TUI

Dont't run it in an IDE. Run it in a terminal window or the 'clear' or 'cls' will not work
Make sure to chage the line: clear = lambda: os.system('cls') #  'clear' on Linux System 'cls' on windows

It will print a 20 by 10 grid of dots '.'
You are the 'X'
You will enter instructions ("Enter instructions \n [R]ight \n [L]eft \n [U]p \n [D]own\n::::") to move the 'X'
You will try and eat the '@' '%' and '$'
